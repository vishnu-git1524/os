# Theera OS Security Features

Theera OS implements comprehensive security measures to protect users and their data from various threats while maintaining usability and performance.

## Security Architecture Overview

### Defense in Depth
Theera OS implements multiple layers of security:
1. **Boot Security**: Secure Boot and signed kernel modules
2. **Access Control**: AppArmor mandatory access control
3. **Network Security**: UFW firewall and network isolation
4. **System Integrity**: File system protection and monitoring
5. **Application Security**: Sandboxing and permission management
6. **Update Security**: Automatic security updates and verification

### Security by Default
All security features are enabled by default with secure configurations:
- Firewall enabled with restrictive default rules
- AppArmor profiles active for critical applications
- Automatic security updates enabled
- Privacy-respecting defaults
- Minimal exposed services

## Boot and System Security

### Secure Boot
Theera OS supports UEFI Secure Boot:
```bash
# Check Secure Boot status
mokutil --sb-state

# Verify kernel signature
sbverify --list /boot/vmlinuz-$(uname -r)
```

**Features:**
- Signed bootloader (shim-signed)
- Signed kernel and modules
- Protection against boot-time malware
- Compatibility with existing Secure Boot implementations

### Kernel Security

#### Kernel Hardening
- **KASLR (Kernel Address Space Layout Randomization)**: Enabled
- **SMEP/SMAP**: Supervisor Mode Execution/Access Prevention
- **Control Flow Integrity**: Protection against ROP/JOP attacks
- **Stack Protection**: Compiler-based stack canaries

#### Kernel Modules
```bash
# Check module signatures
modinfo module_name | grep sig

# List loaded modules
lsmod

# Check module dependencies
modprobe --show-depends module_name
```

### File System Security

#### Disk Encryption
Full disk encryption support with LUKS:
```bash
# Check encryption status
lsblk -f

# Encrypt home directory
ecryptfs-setup-private

# Check file system integrity
fsck /dev/device
```

#### File Permissions
Secure default permissions:
- `/tmp` with sticky bit and noexec
- User home directories with 750 permissions
- System files with appropriate ownership
- SetUID/SetGID programs minimized

## Access Control

### AppArmor Mandatory Access Control

#### Default Profiles
Theera OS includes AppArmor profiles for:
- Web browsers (Firefox, Chrome)
- Email clients (Thunderbird)
- Media players
- Office applications
- System services

#### Managing Profiles
```bash
# List active profiles
aa-status

# Enforce profile
aa-enforce /etc/apparmor.d/firefox

# Set profile to complain mode
aa-complain /etc/apparmor.d/firefox

# Disable profile
aa-disable /etc/apparmor.d/firefox

# Generate new profile
aa-genprof application-name
```

#### Example Firefox Profile
```bash
# Firefox AppArmor profile provides:
- Restricted file system access
- Network access control
- Prevented access to sensitive system files
- Controlled interaction with other applications
```

### User Account Security

#### sudo Configuration
```bash
# Limited sudo access
# Users in sudo group can run administrative commands
# Session timeout configured for security
# Separate root account disabled by default
```

#### Password Policy
```bash
# Strong password requirements
# Account lockout after failed attempts
# Password aging policies
# Two-factor authentication support (optional)
```

## Network Security

### UFW Firewall

#### Default Configuration
```bash
# Check firewall status

ufw default allow outgoing

# Essential outgoing ports allowed:
# 53/udp - DNS
# 80/tcp - HTTP
# 443/tcp - HTTPS
# 123/udp - NTP
```

#### Managing Rules
```bash
# Allow specific service
ufw allow ssh

# Allow specific port
ufw allow 8080/tcp

# Allow from specific IP
ufw allow from 192.168.1.100

# Block specific IP
ufw deny from 203.0.113.100

# Delete rule
ufw delete allow ssh
```

#### Application Profiles
```bash
# List available profiles
ufw app list

# Allow application
ufw allow "Apache Full"

# Show application info
ufw app info "Apache Full"
```

### Network Monitoring

#### Traffic Analysis
```bash
# Monitor network connections
netstat -tulpn
